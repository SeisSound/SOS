**Sounds Of Seismic (SOS)**

Sounds of Seismic (SOS) transforms MiniSEED seismic waveform data into geophysical sonic experiences. GenAI algorithms and sound synthesis convert real-time USGS and EarthScope data into generative ambient soundscapes. A minimalist, browser-based interface streams seismic truths as electronic instruments. SOS scales dynamic sonifications via LLM pattern analysis, inspiring interdisciplinary collaborations to redefine data-driven music. This platform pioneers real-time geophysical insights through music, delivering scalable, innovative sonic experiences for a global audience.
